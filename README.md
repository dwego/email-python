# Python Email Verification System
This Python project is designed to send an email to a specific email address and return a verification code. The verification code can be used for different purposes such as verifying an account or confirming an action.

# Installation
Before running the code, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You also need to install the smtplib and ssl libraries, which can be installed via pip:

Copy code
```python
pip install smtplib
pip install ssl
```

# Usage
To use this project, you need to provide your email credentials and the recipient email address in the email_verification.py file:

Copy code
```python
login = "your_email@example.com"
password = "your_password"
mail = input('Enter your email for verification: ')
```
You can then run the main.py file and follow the prompts to enter the subject and body of the email. After sending the email, the program will return a verification code that was sent to the recipient's email address.
